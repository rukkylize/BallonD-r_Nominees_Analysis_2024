# BallonD-r_Nominees_Analysis_2024
**INTRODUCTION**

This analysis, conducted using Tableau, explores the 2024 Ballon d'Or nominees using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. It highlights key aspects such as country and team representation, player positions, expected goals per 90 minutes, and assist rankings. The insights provide a deeper understanding of the distribution of talent and performance metrics among the nominees.

**KEY INSIGHTS**

**1. Most Represented Country and Team**
Spain has the highest number of nominees (6), followed closely by England (6) and Germany (4).

Real Madrid dominates team representation with 6 players, while Manchester City and Arsenal follow with 4 each.

This suggests that Spain continues to produce top-tier football talent, with Real Madrid leading in club-level contributions.

**2. Positional Breakdown of Nominees**
Midfielders (MF) have the highest representation (11 players), followed by forwards (FW) with 9 players.

Defenders (DF) make up 6 nominees, while only one goalkeeper (GK) is included.

This indicates a strong emphasis on creative and attacking play in the selection criteria, with midfielders playing a crucial role.


**3. Expected Goals (xG) Leaders**

Manchester City leads in expected goals per 90 minutes, followed by Real Madrid and PSG.

This aligns with their attacking dominance in recent seasons, suggesting their players contribute significantly to goal-scoring opportunities.

**4. Top Players by Assists**

√Ålex Grimaldo leads the assist rankings with 13 assists, followed by Nico Williams, Florian Wirtz, and Cole Palmer with 11 each.

Midfielders play a significant role in assists, reinforcing their influence on overall gameplay.

**5. Balanced Team Representation**

While some clubs like Real Madrid dominate, the nominees come from a diverse range of teams, including Bayern Munich, Barcelona, and Leverkusen.

This suggests that top-tier performance is spread across multiple leagues, rather than being concentrated in just a few clubs.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

**1. Focus on Midfield Creativity**

Since midfielders have the highest representation, teams aiming for future Ballon d'Or nominations should prioritize playmakers who contribute both goals and assists.

**2. Strengthening Attacking Play**

Clubs outside the top three in xG (Manchester City, Real Madrid, and PSG) should enhance their offensive strategies to increase goal-scoring chances and individual player recognition.

**3. Defensive Recognition**

With defenders and goalkeepers being underrepresented, future evaluations should consider their impact more comprehensively. This could mean incorporating defensive metrics like tackles,
interceptions, and clean sheets in award considerations.

**4. Youth Development in Underserved Countries**

Countries with lower representation, such as Nigeria and Brazil (1 nominee each), should invest more in scouting and youth development to increase their presence in global nominations.

**5. Team Distribution Monitoring**

While Real Madrid leads, other clubs should analyze what contributes to their success and replicate strategies for player development and performance enhancement.


This analysis provides a strong overview of how the top footballers of 2024 are distributed across countries, clubs, and positions, with key takeaways that can inform future football strategies and player evaluations.
